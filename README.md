Introduction
Accurate and efficient management of product information is essential for the success of e-commerce businesses. This information enables informed decision-making and facilitates effective marketing strategies. However, traditional methods of handling product data may be cumbersome and prone to errors. They often involve manual entry and maintenance processes, leading to inconsistencies and inefficiencies. By harnessing the capabilities of Python programming, we can develop a solution that automates tasks such as adding, reading, updating, and deleting product information. This streamlined approach not only enhances data accuracy and reliability but also improves operational efficiency.

 

The kind of operations that we are going to focus on have an acronym: CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, and Delete).

 

CRUD operations represent the four basic functions that are essential to interact with a database or a data storage system. The acronym CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These operations form the foundation of most applications that store and manipulate data. Understanding CRUD is crucial for developers working on web, software, and database applications.

Here's a brief overview of each operation:

Create: This operation is used to add new records to a database. It involves inserting data into a database table or a data structure. For example, adding a new user to a user database is a Create operation.

Read: The read operation is used to retrieve or read data from a database. It involves querying the database to fetch information based on certain criteria. For example, fetching a list of all users from a user database is a Read operation.

Update: This operation is used to modify existing data in a database. It involves updating one or more fields of a database record. For example, changing a user's email address in a user database is an Update operation.

Delete: The Delete operation is used to remove records from a database. It involves deleting one or more records from a database table. For example, removing a user from a user database is a Delete operation.

These operations are vital for managing data effectively in any application. They allow applications to perform basic data management tasks, ensuring that the data is accurate, consistent, and accessible.

 

In this project, we'll implement a customized version of CRUD operations. Here's an overview of what you'll build:

Create: The creation process is handled by the create() function, which orchestrates three sub-functions:

add_sales_data(): Adds sales data.

add_product_details(): Adds product details.

add_product_descriptions(): Adds product descriptions.

Read: The reading process is facilitated by the read() function, which coordinates three sub-functions:

display_sales_data(): Displays sales data.

display_product_details(): Displays product details.

display_product_descriptions(): Displays product descriptions.

Update: The updating process is managed by the update() function, which invokes three sub-functions:

update_sales_data(): Updates sales data.

update_product_details(): Updates product details.

update_product_descriptions(): Updates product descriptions.

Delete: Deletion is handled by the delete() function.

CRUD: The master function, crud(), serves as the central hub, orchestrating all the operations to perform CRUD actions seamlessly from a single point.

Problem Statement
In the dynamic landscape of e-commerce, efficient management of product information is essential for businesses to thrive. However, organizing and updating vast arrays of product details, sales data, and product descriptions can be a daunting task without the right tools in place. The absence of a robust system for managing product information can lead to inconsistencies, errors, and inefficiencies in operations.
 
To address this problem, you have been hired as a software developer for a Software company that builds various technologies for e-commerce platforms. Your job is to utilize your programming knowledge to automate some of the tasks that occur in these e-commerce platforms. Specifically, your role involves implementing functionalities for seamlessly adding, reading, updating, and deleting product details, sales data, and product descriptions.
